    This calculator is a very basic one,
    honestly idk why you would search for this one, you have one in your own pc, which is way better than mine is.
    Yours can even do roots and extensions, brackets, and all this kind of stuff.
    Yours isnt faulty too, you just cannot crash yours ffs.
    So please, forget this site.
